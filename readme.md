___
A fully Turing-Complete language made purely for millennials.

*Note: `Brainf---` will be reffered to as `BF` for the sake a being politically correct.*

BoiLang is a variation on the language `BF` which turns all the normal characters into variations on the word '*boi*'.

- `yeah` – Starts the program (won't run without it.) *(No `BF` equivalent)*
- `boii` – Adds one to the current cell. *('+' in `BF`)*
- `bboi` – Takes one from the current cell. *('-' in `BF`)*
- `booii` – Goes to the next cell. *('>' in `BF`)*
- `bbooi` – Goes to the previous cell. *('<' in `BF`)*
- `boi?` – Takes in an input and stores its ASCII value. *(',' in `BF`)*
- `boi!` – Prints the ASCII value of the cell. *('.' in `BF`)*

- `bois` – If current cell is zero, goto `boie` but if not, goto the next instruction. *('[' in `BF`)*
- `boie` – If the current cell is zero, continue. Else, goto `bois`. *(']' in `BF`)*

#### Special:
- `boi...` – Prints the value of the cell. *(No `BF` equivalent)*
- `boi??` – Takes a number as input and stores its value. *(No `BF` equivalent)*
